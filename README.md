## Function Documentation: `extract_sections`

### Overview

The `extract_sections` function is designed to segment the OCR-processed text of the PL 751 document into its constituent sections, labeled from A to I. This segmentation is foundational for the subsequent, targeted processing of each section.

### Function Purpose

To systematically divide the entire text into sections based on predefined headings, enabling focused analysis and processing on a per-section basis. This step is critical for handling the document's structure, where each section may contain different types of information requiring specific processing logic.

### Implementation Details

#### Regular Expression Logic

- **Section Heading Pattern**: `r'Part [A-Z]'`
  - **Purpose**: Matches section headings that follow the format "Part" followed by a single uppercase letter, which are used to delineate sections within the PL 751 document.
  - **Explanation**: This pattern is pivotal for identifying the start of each section within the document. By recognizing these headings, the function can accurately split the document into its component sections for further processing.

#### Function Logic

1. **Text Splitting**: Utilizes the `re.split` method with the Section Heading Pattern to divide the text into an array, where each element corresponds to the content of a section.
2. **Section Extraction**: Iterates through the array generated by the split operation, pairing each section's content with its heading to maintain organization.
3. **Data Structuring**: Constructs a list of tuples, each containing a section heading and its associated text, preparing the data for the next processing stages.

#### Code Explanation

```python
sections = re.split(section_pattern, text)
extracted_sections = []

for i in range(1, len(sections)):
    section_heading = re.findall(section_pattern, text)[i - 1]
    section_text = sections[i]
    extracted_sections.append((section_heading, section_text.strip()))
```

- After splitting the text into sections, the function iterates through these sections, extracting the heading for each and pairing it with the corresponding text.
- Each section's text is trimmed of whitespace at the beginning and end to ensure clean data.
- The result is a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a section of the document, ready for further processing and analysis.

### Conclusion

The `extract_sections` function is a critical first step in the document processing workflow of the PL 751 project. By accurately segmenting the document into its constituent sections, it sets the stage for specialized processing tailored to the unique content and requirements of each section. This structured approach to document processing enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall system, ensuring that each section is analyzed and processed in a manner that best fits its content.
