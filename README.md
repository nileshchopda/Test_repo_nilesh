Certainly! Here's the detailed documentation for the `extract_sections` function as part of your project documentation.

---

## Function Documentation: `extract_sections`

### Overview

The `extract_sections` function is designed to segment the OCR-processed text of the PL 751 document into its constituent sections, labeled from A to I. This segmentation is foundational for the subsequent, targeted processing of each section.

### Function Purpose

To systematically divide the entire text into sections based on predefined headings, enabling focused analysis and processing on a per-section basis. This step is critical for handling the document's structure, where each section may contain different types of information requiring specific processing logic.

### Implementation Details

#### Regular Expression Logic

- **Section Heading Pattern**: `r'Part [A-Z]'`
  - **Purpose**: Matches section headings that follow the format "Part" followed by a single uppercase letter, which are used to delineate sections within the PL 751 document.
  - **Explanation**: This pattern is pivotal for identifying the start of each section within the document. By recognizing these headings, the function can accurately split the document into its component sections for further processing.

#### Function Logic

1. **Text Splitting**: Utilizes the `re.split` method with the Section Heading Pattern to divide the text into an array, where each element corresponds to the content of a section.
2. **Section Extraction**: Iterates through the array generated by the split operation, pairing each section's content with its heading to maintain organization.
3. **Data Structuring**: Constructs a list of tuples, each containing a section heading and its associated text, preparing the data for the next processing stages.

#### Code Explanation

```python
sections = re.split(section_pattern, text)
extracted_sections = []

for i in range(1, len(sections)):
    section_heading = re.findall(section_pattern, text)[i - 1]
    section_text = sections[i]
    extracted_sections.append((section_heading, section_text.strip()))
```

- After splitting the text into sections, the function iterates through these sections, extracting the heading for each and pairing it with the corresponding text.
- Each section's text is trimmed of whitespace at the beginning and end to ensure clean data.
- The result is a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a section of the document, ready for further processing and analysis.

### Conclusion

The `extract_sections` function is a critical first step in the document processing workflow of the PL 751 project. By accurately segmenting the document into its constituent sections, it sets the stage for specialized processing tailored to the unique content and requirements of each section. This structured approach to document processing enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall system, ensuring that each section is analyzed and processed in a manner that best fits its content.

Certainly! Here’s the detailed documentation for the `replace_soil_conditions` function within the PL 751 project framework:

---

## Function Documentation: `replace_soil_conditions`

### Overview

The `replace_soil_conditions` function is specifically tailored to enhance the readability and analysis capability of soil condition data extracted from the document. It operates by refining the extracted data using targeted regular expressions to ensure that all soil condition mentions are uniformly formatted and clearly identifiable.

### Function Purpose

This function processes extracted soil condition data throughout the document's text, applying uniform formatting rules to various mentions of soil conditions. Its purpose is to standardize these mentions, which improves the clarity and usability of the data in subsequent analyses or reports.

### Implementation Details

#### Regular Expression Logic

- **Soil Condition Pattern**: `r"Soil Condition\s*(:[a-zA-Z]+: [^:]+Ohm-cm)\s*(:[a-zA-Z]+: [^:]+Ohm-cm)"`
  - **Purpose**: Captures detailed descriptions of soil conditions, specifically focusing on conductivity measurements presented in Ohm-cm.
  - **Explanation**: This complex pattern is designed to accurately identify detailed and specific measurements related to soil conditions, which are crucial for the technical assessment of the piping inspection and remedial actions.

#### Function Logic

1. **Data Extraction**: Searches for patterns that match the predefined soil condition regex within each component's text.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - For each match found, the text is split into its constituent parts, separating the type of condition from its value.
   - This separation allows for the individual processing of each soil condition, ensuring detailed attention to the formatting and presentation of each.
3. **Condition Formatting**:
   - The function formats each condition into a more readable form, appending it to a list of conditions.
   - Additionally, it generates sub-conditions (if necessary) to provide more granular detail, using an alphabetical identifier for each sub-condition.

#### Code Explanation

```python
for section, section_data in kv_component_json.items():
    if 'kv_components' in section_data:
        kv_components = section_data['kv_components']
        for key, value in kv_components.items():
            value = process_soil_conditions(value)
            kv_components[key] = value
```

- Iterates through each section and its components within the document's structured data.
- Applies the `process_soil_conditions` function to each component's text, which extracts and formats all soil conditions according to the specified pattern.
- Updates the text of each component with the newly formatted soil conditions, ensuring that all data is presented uniformly across the document.

### Conclusion

The `replace_soil_conditions` function is vital for ensuring the uniformity and clarity of soil condition data across the PL 751 document. By standardizing the format of this data, the function facilitates more accurate and effective analysis, contributing significantly to the project's goals of enhancing the quality and accessibility of information within piping inspection reports. This function exemplifies the project’s commitment to high standards of data processing and presentation.
